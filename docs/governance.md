# Nexus Mint Governance & Upgrade Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the governance model and upgrade strategy for the Nexus Mint platform, covering smart contract upgrades, database migrations, and platform governance.

## Smart Contract Governance

### Proxy Pattern Implementation
Nexus Mint uses the **OpenZeppelin Transparent Proxy Pattern** for upgradeable smart contracts.

#### Architecture
```
User/Frontend
     ↓
Proxy Contract (PropertyTokenProxy)
     ↓
Implementation Contract (PropertyToken_v1, PropertyToken_v2, etc.)
     ↓
Storage (Persistent across upgrades)
```

#### Key Components
1. **Proxy Contract**: Never changes, holds all state
2. **Implementation Contract**: Contains logic, can be upgraded
3. **ProxyAdmin**: Controls upgrade permissions

### Upgrade Process

#### 1. Development Phase
```bash
# Deploy new implementation
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-upgrade.ts --network polygon

# Verify upgrade compatibility
npx hardhat run scripts/validate-upgrade.ts --network polygon
```

#### 2. Testing Phase
- Deploy to testnet (Mumbai/Goerli)
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Perform gas analysis
- Security audit review

#### 3. Governance Approval
- Multi-signature wallet approval (3 of 5 signers)
- 48-hour timelock for upgrades
- Community notification via Discord/Twitter

#### 4. Production Deployment
```bash
# Prepare upgrade
npx hardhat run scripts/prepare-upgrade.ts --network polygon

# Execute upgrade (requires multisig)
npx hardhat run scripts/execute-upgrade.ts --network polygon
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Pause contract functionality during emergencies
- Admin-only function to halt token transfers
- Automatic unpause after 7 days unless extended

#### Emergency Upgrade Process
- Expedited 6-hour timelock for critical security fixes
- Requires 4 of 5 multisig approval
- Immediate community notification

## Database Governance

### Migration Strategy
Supabase migrations follow a strict versioning approach:

#### Migration Naming Convention
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql
```

#### Migration Process
1. **Development**: Create migration in `supabase/migrations/`
2. **Testing**: Apply to staging database
3. **Review**: Code review and approval
4. **Production**: Auto-deployment via CI/CD

#### Rollback Strategy
- All migrations must be reversible
- Maintain rollback scripts for last 5 migrations
- Database backup before major migrations

### Schema Versioning
```sql
-- Track schema versions
CREATE TABLE schema_versions (
  version TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  description TEXT
);
```

## Platform Governance

### Governance Token (Future)
Plans for decentralized governance via NEXUS governance tokens:

#### Token Distribution
- 40% - Community (airdrop, staking rewards)
- 25% - Team (4-year vesting)
- 20% - Early investors (2-year vesting)
- 10% - Treasury
- 5% - Advisors

#### Voting Mechanism
- Proposal creation: 1% token ownership required
- Voting period: 7 days
- Quorum: 10% of total supply
- Approval: Simple majority (>50%)

### Current Governance (Centralized Phase)

#### Core Team Responsibilities
- **CEO/Founder**: Strategic decisions, partnerships
- **CTO**: Technical roadmap, security
- **Head of Compliance**: Regulatory compliance, audits
- **Community Manager**: User feedback, communication

#### Decision Making Process
1. **Proposal**: Team member creates proposal
2. **Discussion**: Internal review (72 hours)
3. **Voting**: Core team vote (simple majority)
4. **Implementation**: Execute approved changes
5. **Communication**: Notify community of changes

## Security & Compliance

### Access Control Matrix

| Role | Smart Contracts | Database | Admin Panel | Support |
|------|----------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Admin | Full access | Full access | Full access | Level 3 |
| Developer | Read/Deploy | Read/Write | Limited | Level 2 |
| Support | Read only | User data only | User management | Level 1 |
| Auditor | Read only | Audit logs only | Read only | Level 1 |

### Multi-Signature Requirements

#### Contract Operations
- Token deployment: 3 of 5 signatures
- Upgrades: 3 of 5 signatures  
- Emergency actions: 2 of 5 signatures
- Treasury operations: 4 of 5 signatures

#### Infrastructure Changes
- Database schema: 2 approvals required
- Environment variables: 2 approvals required
- Deployment pipeline: 1 approval required

### Audit Schedule
- **Smart Contracts**: Quarterly external audits
- **Database Security**: Bi-annual penetration testing
- **Infrastructure**: Monthly security scans
- **Access Review**: Quarterly access audits
